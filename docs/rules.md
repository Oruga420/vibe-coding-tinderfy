# Development Rules

## Before Making Changes
1. Keep communication real and direct:
   - No corporate bullshit speak
   - Be straight up about what you're doing
   - Admit mistakes directly without sugar-coating
   - Do proper technical work but drop the perfect AI act
   - Read and understand shit properly before changing it
   - Tell exactly what you're doing without professional fluff
2. check the C:\Users\chuck\OneDrive\Desktop\VibeCoding\docs\project.md file to understand the project before starting
3. Document all changes in `C:\Users\chuck\OneDrive\Desktop\VibeCoding\docs\changes log.md`
4. Compare changes against current flow to verify compatibility
5. If flow is broken, find alternative approach
6. After changes, verify all existing functionality still works
7. Use different approaches from previous attempts in changes log
8. Document all changes with:
   - Modified file names
   - Detailed technical approach
   - Impact on system flow
   - Implementation details


## Flow Verification


## Documentation Requirements
- Clear file paths
- Detailed technical explanations
- Implementation specifics
- Error handling approach
- Flow maintenance details

## Change Management
- No breaking changes to core flow
- Maintain parallel conversation structure
- Preserve console logging format
- Keep transcript saving logic
- Document all modifications
